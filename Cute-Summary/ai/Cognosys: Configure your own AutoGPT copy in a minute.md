AutoGPT has been causing a stir on the internet lately and is ubiquitous ðŸŒŸ. It allows AutoGPT to come up with plans and execute tasks on its own. However, the official installation and usage is currently a bit difficult for non-technical people.

The tool Chris will present to you today is Cognosys, a visual tool for running AutoGPT on the Web, which allows you to use the powerful features of AutoGPT with just a simple configuration.

Then enter **Open API Key** in the pop-up box, if you already have **Open API Key**, you can fill it in directly, if not, you can click the "**Get your API Key**" button on the top of the pop-up box to enter OpenAI's website to create it. Then you can copy it and fill it in:

That's how easy it is to configure.

## 3. Configure AutoGPT Roles and Tasks

The third step is to start using your AutoGPT. We need to configure your agent name and the tasks that need to be accomplished first.

## 4. AutoGPT starts the task

In the fourth step, you can start your AutoGPT to perform the task. We can start the task by clicking "Start" in the bottom left corner of the page, and then AutoGPT will start to perform the task until the end.
Then AutoGPT starts executing the task until it finishes.

## 5. View AutoGPT Task Execution

The fifth step is to view the AutoGPT task execution. We can see the AutoGPT task execution in real time in the middle of the page and the execution results of the key tasks on the right side of the page.
