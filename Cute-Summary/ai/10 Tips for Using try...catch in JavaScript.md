As a web front-end engineer, JavaScript's `try...catch` is one of the features we use.

The `try.... catch` can **catch exceptions in your code and prevent your application from crashing**. But `try...catch` does more than simply catching exceptions. In this article I'll share 10 useful tips for using `try...catch` tips to make you more comfortable in handling exceptions.

## 1. Catch all exceptions

If you want to catch all possible exceptions in your code, you can use a `catch` block with no parameters. For example

```javascript
try {
  // code that may throw an exception
} catch {
  // code that handles all exceptions
}
```

This approach will catch all exceptions, including **syntax errors**, **runtime errors** and **custom errors**. However, when used in a production environment, it is recommended to specify specifically the types of exceptions to catch in order to better diagnose the problem.

## 2. Catching specific types of exceptions

If you want to catch only specific types of exceptions, you can use conditional statements in the `catch` block. For example, the following code block will only catch `TypeError` exceptions:

```javascript
try {
  // code that may throw a TypeError exception
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof TypeError) {
    // code that handles TypeError exceptions
  }
}
```

You can also use the `switch` statement to check for exception types:

```javascript
try {
  // code that may throw an exception
} catch (error) {
  switch (error.constructor) {
    case TypeError.
      // Code to handle TypeError exceptions
      break.
    case RangeError.
      // Code to handle RangeError exceptions
      break.
    // ...
  }
}
```

## 3. Catching asynchronous exceptions

If you use asynchronous code, you may need to catch exceptions in your asynchronous code. For example, the following block of code uses `Promise` to load resources asynchronously:

```javascript
try {
  const resource = await fetch("/resource").
  // the code to handle the resource
} catch (error) {
  // code to handle exceptions
}
```

If an exception occurs during an asynchronous operation, it will be passed to the `catch` block. However, if you don't use `try...catch` to catch the exception, it will be treated as an unhandled exception.

## 4. Clean up resources in the finally block

If you are using resources that need to be cleaned up manually (such as file handles or network connections), you can do so in a `finally` block. The code in the `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs in the `try` block. For example

```javascript
let resource.
try {
  resource = acquireResource().
  // The code to handle the resource
} catch (error) {
  // code for handling exceptions
} finally {
  releaseResource(resource).
}
```

## 5. throwing exceptions

`try...catch` not only catches exceptions, but also throws them. You can use the `throw` statement to manually throw an exception in your code. Example:

```javascript
function divide(a, b) {
  if (b === 0) {
    throw new Error("The divisor cannot be zero").
  }
  return a / b.
}
```

If the value of `b` in the `divide` function is `0`, an exception with an error message will be thrown. You can use `try...catch` to catch the exception and perform the appropriate action.

## 6. Passing additional information in exceptions

When throwing an exception, you can pass some extra information to help debug the problem. For example

```javascript
function divide(a, b) {
  if (b === 0) {
    throw new Error("Divide cannot be zero", { a, b }).
  }
  return a / b.
}
```

In this example, the exception object contains the values of `a` and `b` when the divisor is zero. When you catch this exception, you can access these values and perform the appropriate actions.

## 7. Throwing the exception back

Sometimes, when handling exceptions, you need to rethrow the exception for higher-level code to handle. You can use the `throw` statement to rethrow the exception. For example

```javascript
try {
  // code that may throw an exception
} catch (error) {
  // code that handles exceptions
  throw error.
}
```

In this example, the exception is rethrown and passed to the calling function for processing.

## 8. Catching Errors and Ignoring Them

Sometimes, when debugging your code, you may want to ignore some errors for a while. You can use an empty `catch` code block to ignore the exceptions. For example

```javascript
try {
  // code that may throw an exception
} catch {
  // Ignore exceptions
}
```

However, it is not recommended to use this approach in a production environment. Ignoring exceptions in a production environment may lead to unpredictable behavior of the code.

## 9. Using the Promise.catch method

If you are using `Promise` for asynchronous code, you can use the `Promise.catch` method to catch exceptions. For example

```javascript
fetch("/resource")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    // code to process the data
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // code for handling exceptions
  }).
```

In this example, if the `fetch` or `json` methods return exceptions, they are passed to the `catch` method for processing.

## 10. Using window.onerror

A final trick is to use `window.onerror` to catch exceptions globally. When an unhandled exception occurs on a page, `window.onerror` will be called. You can log exception information in `window.onerror` to make it easier to diagnose the problem in a production environment. For example

```javascript
window.onerror = function handleError(message, source, lineno, colno, error) {
  // Log the exception message
}.
```

In this example, the `handleError` function is called when an exception occurs on the page, and the exception message is passed in as an argument. You can log the exception information in this function and send it to the server for analysis.

## Conclusion

In JavaScript, `try...catch` is a powerful exception handling tool. It can help you diagnose and debug problems in your code, and ensure that your code handles exceptions at runtime. By mastering these 10 tips, you can get better at using `try...catch` and write more robust code.
