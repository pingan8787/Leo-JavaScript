React 18 is the latest version of the React library, introducing new features and performance improvements to further enhance the performance and user experience of React applications. However, when developing with React 18, it is still necessary to pay attention to performance issues to ensure the smoothness and responsiveness of the application. This article will introduce how to keep React 18 components pure, avoid unnecessary re-rendering and performance waste.

## 1. Component Separation

Component separation is the key to keeping React 18 components pure. We should limit each component to a single responsibility and break it down into smaller components. This helps reduce code complexity, improve readability and maintainability, and helps achieve better performance.

Before optimization:

```jsx
import React from "react";

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
        <p>{this.props.description}</p>
        <button onClick={this.props.onButtonClick}>Click me</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

After optimization:

```jsx
import React from "react";

class Title extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>;
  }
}

class Description extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>{this.props.description}</p>;
  }
}

class Button extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.props.onClick}>Click me</button>;
  }
}

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Title title={this.props.title} />
        <Description description={this.props.description} />
        <Button onClick={this.props.onButtonClick} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

## 2. Avoid Unnecessary Re-rendering

Concurrent Mode introduced in React 18 can improve application performance, but it also requires us to avoid unnecessary re-rendering. We should use React optimization tools such as React.memo() and useMemo() to reduce unnecessary re-rendering and use old APIs such as shouldComponentUpdate() and React.PureComponent to avoid unnecessary re-rendering of components.

Before optimization:

```jsx
import React from "react";

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
        <p>{this.props.description}</p>
        <button onClick={this.props.onButtonClick}>Click me</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

After optimization:

```jsx
import React from "react";

class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
        <p>{this.props.description}</p>
        <button onClick={this.props.onButtonClick}>Click me</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

## 3. Choose the Right State Management Tool

React 18 does not provide a state management tool, so we need to choose a state management tool that suits our application, such as Redux and MobX. We need to avoid excessive use of state in components and separate business logic from component logic.

Before optimization:

```jsx
import React from "react";

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleClick() {
    this.setState({
      count: this.state.count + 1,
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

After optimization:

```jsx
// 使用Redux作为状态管理工具
import React from "react";
import { connect } from "react-redux";

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  handleClick = () => {
    this.props.dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.props.count}</p>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  return {
    count: state.count,
  };
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(MyComponent);
```

## 4. Import Dependencies on Demand

React 18 allows us to use new features such as React.lazy() and Suspense to import dependencies on demand during development. This helps reduce the loading time of our application and allows us to better control the size of our application.

Before optimization:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";

import App from "./App";
import About from "./About";
import Contact from "./Contact";

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Switch>
      <Route exact path="/" component={App} />
      <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
    </Switch>
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

After optimization:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";

import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Switch>
      <Route exact path="/" component={App} />
      <Route path="/about" component={React.lazy(() => import("./About"))} />
      <Route
        path="/contact"
        component={React.lazy(() => import("./Contact"))}
      />
    </Switch>
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

## 5. Use useMemo() for Memorization

When the computation within a component is large, it will be re-computed every time it is re-rendered, which affects performance. Using useMemo() can cache computation results and only re-compute when the dependencies change, which can significantly improve component rendering performance. In the example above, we use useMemo() to cache the result of the filter() function, avoiding recalculating data every time it is re-rendered.

Before optimization:

```jsx
import React from "react";

function MyComponent({ data }) {
  const filteredData = data.filter((item) => item.isApproved);
  return (
    <ul>
      {filteredData.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

After optimization:

```jsx
import React, { useMemo } from "react";

function MyComponent({ data }) {
  const filteredData = useMemo(
    () => data.filter((item) => item.isApproved),
    [data]
  );
  return (
    <ul>
      {filteredData.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## 6. Use React.PureComponent for Shallow Comparison

When the props or state of a component change, React will re-render the component. In some cases, changes in component props or state will not affect the rendering results of the component. In this case, we can use React.PureComponent for shallow comparison to avoid unnecessary re-rendering. React.PureComponent implements the shouldComponentUpdate() method by default and only re-renders when the props or state of the component change at a deep level. In the example above, we use React.PureComponent instead of a regular component class to avoid unnecessary re-rendering.

Before optimization:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{this.props.title}</p>
        <p>{this.props.content}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

After optimization:

```jsx
import React, { PureComponent } from "react";

class MyComponent extends PureComponent {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{this.props.title}</p>
        <p>{this.props.content}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## 7. Use Functional Components instead of Class Components

Functional components have better performance and simpler code than class components. Since functional components do not need to maintain state and do not need to perform lifecycle management, they render faster. In the example above, we use functional components instead of class components to reduce code size and rendering time.

Before optimization:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{this.props.title}</p>
        <p>{this.props.content}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

After optimization:

```jsx
import React from "react";

function MyComponent({ title, content }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{title}</p>
      <p>{content}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 8. Component Testing

Finally, we should test our React 18 components to ensure their functionality and performance. We can use testing frameworks such as Jest and Enzyme to write unit tests and integration tests, and use tools such as React Test Utils to simulate the rendering process of components for better testing.

Before optimization:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";

ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

After optimization:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <MyComponent />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```
